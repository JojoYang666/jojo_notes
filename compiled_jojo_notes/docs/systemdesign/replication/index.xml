      <description>Leaders and Followers # Leader-based replication/master-slave replication # client sends request to the leader which first writes the new data to its local storage Other replicas known as followers whenever the leader writes the new data to its local storage -&amp;gt; sends the data change to all of its followers as part of a replication log each replica take the log and write it to the local storage when client want to read from the db, it can either query the leader or any of followers.</description>

      <description>Implementation of Replication Logs # Statement-based replication # The leader logs every write request that it executes ans sends that statement log to its followers. -&amp;gt; each follower parses and executes that sql statement as if it had been received from a client. This approach to replication can break down
Any statment that calls nondeterministic function(e.g. now()) is likely to generate a differrent value on each replica if statements depend on the existing data in the db, they must be executed in exactly the same order on each replica.</description>
